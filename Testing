NOTICE: This is the exact same guide that's up regarding Freedom 2.  The same
combinations apply in Unite, so I thought I'd submit this to Unite's FAQ page
as well.

"Is Meat and Fruit going to give me buffs, or kill my Health?"

Did that last sentence sound familiar?  I don't know about everyone else, but 
I, personally, am getting sick and tired of guessing what does what every time 
I want some buffs in the kitchen.  I decided that it's time for someone to 
buckle down and do what no one else wants to do: document every single combi-
nation of every food type with every amount of kitties you can have in your 
kitchen.  Everyone knew it NEEDED to be done, so I decided to pick up the 
slack.  In other words, the purpose of this guide is to concisely inform you of
exactly what all the combinations do with exact numbers, so that you can decide
which you want, and which you don't, regardless of how far in the game you are.

Additionally, due to recent e-mails that I have been getting, it seems         
necessary to add another section to this FAQ about the specifics of the Felyne
Chefs.  So, after the section regarding the ingredient combinations you will
find a relatively brief FAQ on the basics of what the Chefs' stats exactly
mean, what they affect, etc.

The second half of this FAQ will not be for everyone.  In fact, newbs will find
it expedient; vets will find it extraneous.  On the other hand, if you're
confused about something the Felyne Chef stats do, please check that half of
the FAQ before e-mailing me to ensure that your question hasn't already been 
answered.  Thank you.

Despite how badly I would love to always give you exact numbers with every-
thing, that's not always an option.  This is one of those cases.  I can only
give you estimates with the attack boosts.

Small Attack Boost = +1~3% Base Attack
Large Attack Boost = +3~5% Base Attack

These are just early findings, I don't know if the Attack boost is based on a
percentage, but I know it's not a numerical value for each weapon type, as 
I've switched out several different weapons of the same type, and seen them   
each get differing attack boosts.  This leads me to conclude that the boost is
a percentage.  I've made note of the rough percentage of--give or take--the 
boost, and given it a name I felt appropriate given the size of the boost.
Some attack boosts were bigger than others, I noticed, but remember that the
words "Small" and "Large" are relative, so take it with a grain of salt.
Again, if you notice that I have made an obvious mistake somewhere, or if you
find the exact formula for the attack boost, feel free to let me know at my
personal e-mail, and I will be sure to include you in the credits.  This is
my first FAQ, so I won't ignore a little constructive criticism either.

           |  |               |  |
           ***o---------------o***

The level of your Felyne Chef will affect three different things.  The first,
and most important, is the number of ingredients you get to choose from when
deciding what to eat.

NOTE: Keep in mind that only your first Felyne Chef will affect this.  Also,
see how when you sit down to eat, there's two pages of ingredient space?  When
the first Felyne Chef on your list is at level 9, all of the slots will be
open.  In the meantime, the number of open slots will increase as the Chef
levels up.

Every time you sit down to eat, the computer will take into account the
number of slots you have available for ingredients and will randomly 
generate ingredients to fill the list (without repetition).  This means that
the only way to guarantee that you will consistently get the same food
ingredients, and thusly be able to consistently get the same buff, is to have
your first Felyne Chef be level 9, thus always having access to every
ingredient (albeit in a random order).  Already, you can see that Felyne Chef
level is important if you're trying to regularly obtain effective buffs.

The second thing that a Felyne Chef's level affects is how often he'll
activate one of his Whim skills.  There are actually two things that affect
the odds of a Chef's Whim skill activating, but I'll delve into that in 
Section VIII.

The last thing that a Felyne's level affects is his success rate with
cooking your meat/fish for you.  As you progress further in the game, this
will become increasingly important to you.  You'll especially appreciate it
if you've been playing the series for a while.  For the first time in the
series, MHF2 has eliminated the need for meat runs altogether.  Now, with 
the Granny item download, you can buy Raw Meat, and with the Felyne Chefs you
can have it cooked for you.  No need to ever bother with going on a quest and
manually cooking steaks the slow way ever again.  A level 9 Felyne Chef will
rarely mess up your food, and most of the time will hook you up with some
Gourmet Steaks as well.

           ***o---------------o***

Felynes can cook Raw Meat for you, and a number of different types of fish.
The Raw Meat will turn into Rare, Burnt, Well-Done, or Gourmet Steaks.
The cooked fish basically work as Immunizers with a Well-Done Steak-length
consumption animation--nothing too special.  There are other benefits too,
but I won't get into that here.  Following, however, is a list of the
different types of cookable fish, thanks to Arkem3.

|Bomb Arrowana    |Yes       |
|Burst Arrowana   |Yes       |
|Knife Mackerel   |Yes       |
|Pin Tuna         |Yes       |
|Rumblefish       |Yes       |
|Springnight Carp |Yes       |
|Sushifish        |Yes       |
|Ancient Fish     |No        |
|Glutton Tuna     |No        |

|Small Goldenfish |No        |
+-----------------+----------+

After you pay a cat a given amount of z to cook your food for you, you'll 
have to go on a quest and come back later.  Afterwards, you'll be able 
to pick up your food.  Remember, the higher the Felyne Chef level, the more 
likely they are to cook your food well.  It's as simple as that.  Also keep
in mind that they will only cook up to 10 of a single item at a time.

==================================================

           ***o---------------o***
           |  |    -VIII-     |  |
           |  |  Felyne Whim  |  |
           |  |    skills     |  |
           ***o---------------o***

First of all, allow me to say that this is about HOW to get Whim skills, NOT
which ones are the best, or which ones do what.  Which ones are the best is
something you should decide for yourself, and if you want to know which ones
do what, then KingOfMH has already written a thorough guide just for you.
With that said, let's start from the beginning.

Each cat comes with three random skills (randomly determined when he spawned
in the list of cats available for hire, that is).  After you have your 
Felyne(s) make a meal for you by combining ingredients, there will be a
chance that each Felyne that cooked for you will bestow you with an
additional ability by activating one of its Felyne Whim skills.

When a Felyne's Whim skill activates, the kitty will buff you with one of the
three skills on its list.  There is no way of choosing which one activates,
and there is no way of making any one particular skill of the three more
likely to be chosen than the other two.

From what I understand, a Felyne's Whim skill will not activate unless at
least one of its ingredient specialties coincides with at least one of the 
ingredients you just cooked food with.  

For example, let's say you have three Felynes working in your kitchen, and you
just combined Kut Beans with Buffalo Butter for Defense +10 and Stamina +25.
Now let's say that all three of the cats that just made you dinner specialize
in Meat, Fruit, Vegetable, Drink, Fish--anything but Bran or MIlk.  In this
case, none of your Felynes' Whim skills will activate.

However, let's say that one of your Felynes has a specialty in either Bran or
Milk.  Now there is a >0% chance that that particular Felyne's Whim skill will
activate.  How much greater than 0%?  Well, that depends.  If the cat is level
9, and has 3 stars in Bran and Milk, then the odds are in your favor.  If the
cat is only level 1 and only has one star in either Bran OR Milk, well... the
odds are pretty slim.

tl;dr?  Here's a summary. The two things that affect a Felyne Chef's odds of 
one of his Whim skills activating are ingredient specialization and level.  At
least one of the two ingredients that you choose to combine MUST also be one
of the ingredients that is listed on your Felyne Chef's specs, or NO SKILLS
WILL ACTIVATE.  If your Felyne Chef has two ingredients that match up with
both of the ingredients that you just combined, the activation odds will go up.
If both of those listed ingredients have three stars, and the Felyne is at
level 9, then the odds have been maximized in your favor.  However, you CANNOT
alter what your cat specializes in, nor can you alter the number of stars
associated with them.

This is where I thank Thraadash for his invaluable aid.  He politely informed
me on the message boards that Meat + Meat with two felynes gives Health +20.
Don't worry, I tested it myself, and it's correct.  Thank you again, 
Thraadash.

Thanks also go to, again, Arkem3, for e-mailing me the Cookable Fish list.

One final statement is in order...

Thank you everyone, for playing Monster Hunter, and making Capcom bring this
amazing game overseas, thus making this guide possible.  Let's continue to 
support Capcom in hopes that they'll make more Monster Hunter games in the
future, leading to more monsters, more weapons--and most importantly--more
people to play with all over the world!  Now with that said...

Go hunt down some dragons.
